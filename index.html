    <h3>Partition Mapping: Safety of the Other</h3>
    <h2>Aatreyi and Aditi</h2>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The Partition in 1947 was caused by the British haphazardly dividing the Indian subcontinent in 1971.
      They greatly undermined its diversity by splitting the land according to the major religions.
      Pakistan and present day Bangladesh were made to harbour the Muslims whereas India would harbour the Hindus and Sikhs, causing a mass migration across the Pakistan-India and India-Bangladesh borders.
      A few decades after the Partition, Bangladesh broke off from Pakistan and formed its own country, causing yet another religion-driven migration in 1971.
      This map aims to highlight the safety, or lack thereof, of the "other" religion in the three countries by plotting the negative interactions that took place in each country, according to the religion of the person.
      Each country's [colour intensity] varies according to the fraction of interactions that are negative.
      The data used is taken from several autobiographies that document the Partitions of 1947 and 1971.

    <h1>Pakistan</h1>
    <p>
      Pakistan had 118 Hindu negative interactions out of 369 in total which accounts for 32% of negative Hindu interactions.

    <h1>India</h1>
    <p>
      India had 163 Muslim negative interactions out of 477 in total which accounts for 34% of negative Muslim interactions.
    </p>

  <section id="part_4">
    <h1>Bangladesh</h1>
    <p>
      Bangladesh had 163 Hindu & Sikh negative interactions out of 477 in total which accounts for 34% of Hindu & Sikh negative interactions

 From all these analysis we see that the “other” religion has had a very high percentage of negative interactions especially given that our data had lot of NA entries.

 Another thing we wished to notice was the gender that was more affected in the negative interactions. We looked at Bangladesh to find that:

 Bangalesh Female Neg: 34,  Public: 26, Private: 8, 76%

 Bang Male Neg: 42,  Public: 39, Private: 3, 92%



 This supports the generate narrative of men going out during the partition while women were recommended to stay inside which might have led to less public negative interaction for women compared to men.

 However, we wanted to check if this is true in general and looked at the total female negative public interactions compared to male negative public interactions.



 Female Negative Public interactions = 27/42 = 64%
 Male negative Public Interactions = 49/64 = 56%

 Hence, this might have not been necessarily true. We could not do the comparison country wise due to lack of data.

    <h1>Cluster of Negative Interactions Near the Border</h1>
    <p>
      Total public negative interactions - 93, 85% of total.
      Total private negative interactions - 16, 14.6% of total.
Female Negative:
Private - 9, Public -27, Total- 36.
Private to Total: 9/36 = 25%
Public to Total: 75%

Male Negative:
Private - 6, Public - 49, Total - 55
Private to Total: 6/55 = 10.9%

Public to Total: 49/55 = 89%
    </p>

    <h1>Baradari in UP</h1>
    <p>
      It's surprising to see a cluster of negative interactions in central India, an area that is far from both the Pakistan-India and India-Bengladesh border.
      A lot of the interactions in that area are from Attia Hosain's Sunlight on a Broken Column, referring to negatively charged events that took place in Baradari, Lucknow.
      Built by Wajid Ali Shah in 1854, it was created as a place of mourning.
      Conflicts taking place even at the center of the country goes to show how the effects of the Partition spread through an entire region, affecting the mindsets and lives of people everywhere.
