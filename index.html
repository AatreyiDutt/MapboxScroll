    <h3>Partition Mapping: Safety of the Other</h3>
    <h2>Aatreyi Dutt and Aditi Tibarewal</h2>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The Partition in 1947 was caused by the British haphazardly dividing the Indian subcontinent. 
      They greatly undermined its diversity by splitting the land according to the major religions.
      Pakistan and present day Bangladesh were made to harbour the Muslims whereas India would harbour the Hindus and Sikhs, causing a mass migration across the Pakistan-India and India-Bangladesh borders.
      A few decades after the Partition, Bangladesh broke off from Pakistan and formed its own country, causing yet another religion-driven migration in 1971.
      This map aims to highlight the safety, or lack thereof, of the "other" religion in the three countries by plotting the negative interactions that took place in each country, according to the religion of the person.
      Each country's colour intensity varies according to the fraction of negative interactions experienced by the "other" religion.
      The data used is taken from several autobiographies that document the Partitions of 1947 and 1971.

    <h1>Pakistan</h1>
    <p>
      In Muslim-majority Pakistan, the people of "other" religions were Hindus and Sikhs.
      Of all the negative interactions that took place in Pakistan, we observe that 32% involved Hindus and/or Sikhs.
      Considering the fact that a lot of the data contained null entries for religion, 32% is a relatively large percentage.

    <h1>India</h1>
    <p>
      In Hindu/Sikh-majority India, the people of "other" religions were Muslims.
      Of all the negative interactions that took place in India, we observe that 33% involved Muslims.
      It comes as no surprise that the total number of negative interactions in India exceeds that of the other countries involved.
      As the country wedged between 2 partitions, India was bound to be the epicentre of violence.

    <h1>Bangladesh</h1>
    <p>
      In Muslim-majority Bangladesh, the people of "other" religions were Hindus and Sikhs.
      Of all the negative interactions that took place in Bangladesh, we observe that 17% involved Muslims.
      For the smallest of the 3 countries involved in the Partitions, Bangladesh endured several negative events, especially during the 1971 partition.

      Upon taking a closer look at the modality of the locations in Bangladesh where the negative interactions took place, we can also further analyse the genders involved in the events.
      From the chart below, we can see that males tended to be more involved in public negative events rather than women.

      <h1>Cluster of Negative Interactions Near the Border</h1>
      <p>
        To understand the location modality of the interactions, we looked at the data of the percentage of public negative interactions over total negative interactions compared to the percentage of private negative interactions over total negative interaction.
        We observe that the public negative interaction accounts for 85.4% of the negative public interactions.
        This can be explained by the fact that the public spaces would possibly be more unsafe during the chaos of partition.
        <img src = "https://i.imgur.com/0Ep6FET.jpeg" width = "95%">
        Further, we tried to understand the relationship between the gender and negative interaction in public and private spaces.
        We found that a male had a higher chance of going through a negative interaction in public space than a female.
        About 75% of the negative interactions for females were in public spaces compared to 89.1% of that of the men.

    <h1>Baradari in UP</h1>
    <p>
      It's surprising to see a cluster of negative interactions in central India, an area that is far from the Pakistan-India and India-Bengladesh borders.
      A lot of the interactions in that area are from Attia Hosain's Sunlight on a Broken Column, referring to negatively charged events that took place in Baradari, Lucknow.
      Built by Wajid Ali Shah in 1854, it was created as a place of mourning.
      Conflicts taking place even at the center of the country goes to show how the effects of the Partition spread through an entire region, affecting the mindsets and lives of people everywhere.
