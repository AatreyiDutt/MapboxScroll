    <h3>Partition Mapping: Safety of the Other</h3>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The Partition in 1947 was caused by the British haphazardly dividing the Indian subcontinent in 1971.
      They greatly undermined its diversity by splitting the land according to the major religions.
      Pakistan and present day Bangladesh were made to harbour the Muslims whereas India would harbour the Hindus and Sikhs, causing a mass migration across the Pakistan-India and India-Bangladesh borders.
      A few decades after the Partition, Bangladesh broke off from Pakistan and formed its own country, causing yet another religion-driven migration in 1971.
      This map aims to highlight the safety, or lack thereof, of the "other" religion in the three countries by plotting the negative interactions that took place in each country, according to the religion of the person.
      Each country's [colour intensity] varies according to the fraction of interactions that are negative.
      The data used is taken from several autobiographies that document the Partitions of 1947 and 1971.
